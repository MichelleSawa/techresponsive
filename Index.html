<div id="intro">
<p>Using the human-centered design process as my guide, I conduct qualitative research to gather insights and humanize brands with words and customer-focused copy. <br>
  <br>
There are few things I enjoy more than talking to people and hearing their stories. My passion for people led me to fields with communication and connection at the core—writing, marketing, teaching, and comedy.<br>
<br>
I've worked at email marketing and communication firms, taught reading intervention at a charter school, written a marketing book called Car Dog Millionaire, studied improvisation at Second City, and even dabbled in stand-up comedy in Brazil. Now, I've landed in the IT world and am helping Liongard enable insight through automation. </p>

	  <section><h3>Teaching Teens Human-Centered Design</h3> As a former classroom teacher, I still have great passion for teaching. I decided to go back to the classroom to teach my former students about human-centered design. <a href="https://medium.com/creativity-in-the-classroom/a-prototype-program-building-a-creative-outlet-for-students-621c96334f66">A Prototype Program: Building a Creative Outlet for Students</a>. </section>
	  <section> <h3>OWLFA Financial Advisors</h3> Owlfa Financial Advisors hired me to help them reach their audience: teachers trying to navigate retirement savings. I conducted a qualitative research study and wrote human-focused copy which can be seen on their <a href="https://owlfa.com">current website.</a> </section><br>
	  <section><h3>Writing a Marketing Book for Car Dealers</h3>
	In 2015, I co-wrote a marketing book with one of my clients. The funniest part about this project was the fact that I knew close to nothing about cars. I recapped the experience on Medium: <a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/how-to-write-a-book-on-a-topic-you-know-nothing-about-c7d6742534bb">How to Write a Book on a Topic You Know Nothing About.</a> You can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Car-Dog-Millionaire-Internet-Dealership-ebook/dp/B017Y602G4">Car Dog Millionaire on Amazon.</a> It has lots of 5-star reviews, which makes you wonder if it’s fake! ;)
